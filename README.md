# SQL-Projects

Welcome to my SQL Projects repository! This collection of projects showcases my skills and expertise in SQL, including database creation, data querying, performance optimization, and data analysis. From September 2023 to May 2024, I recently completed an internship as a part of Holy Name Medical Center's Data Science Team.
