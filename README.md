# SQL-Projects

Welcome to my SQL Projects repository! From September 2023 to May 2024, I completed an internship as part of Holy Name Medical Center's Data Science Team. This repository contains a variety of SQL projects that I have worked on to demonstrate my capabilities in SQL programming and database management. Each project is organized into its own folder with its respective SQL Query and the results.
